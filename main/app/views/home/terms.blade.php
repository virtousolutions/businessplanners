                        <p>We may be legally required to obtain various formal proofs of identity and address before we can proceed with any Contract. We may carry out an on-line search for this purpose, and you shall assist us in this process. If this on-line search fails to provide us with satisfactory proof of identity and address for any person or business then we will confirm what alternative proofs of identity we require, and we will not be obliged to continue with any Contract, and reserve the right to cancel any Contract, until we have received such alternative proofs in a form satisfactory to us.</p>

                        <p>Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</p>

If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.</p>
