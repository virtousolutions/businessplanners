A young accountant dies. He immediately goes up to heaven (wishful thinking we know) and meets Peter. Because Peter is an organised sort of Saint, he goes through the required details...
<br>
<br>
How old are you? - <strong>Peter</strong>
<br>
33 - <strong>The Accountant</strong>
<br>
That’s impossible! - <strong>Peter</strong>
